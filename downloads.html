            <p>
                There is a lot of excitement and a lot of confusion when it comes to the Sacrament of Confirmation. Let’s start with what
                Confirmation is NOT.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Misconception #1:</strong> You Become an Adult in the Church with the Sacrament of Confirmation.
                The Sacrament used to be celebrated at birth and now varies in age as to when it’s celebrated. It marks a
                sign of spiritual maturity, but not being an “adult” in the eyes of the Church.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Misconception #2:</strong> The Sacrament of Confirmation is about “choosing to be Catholic” by “confirming”
                your faith. The Sacrament of Confirmation is about strengthening and completing the grace you were given
                at Baptism. While you must discern if you are ready for this sacrament, you are not “choosing” to become
                Catholic or making your faith your own.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Misconception #3:</strong> You graduate from religious education once you are confirmed and can now
                choose what is right for you in your faith. Confirmation is a sacrament of initiation. Our faith is a lifelong
                journey. We can always experience deeper conversion, and Jesus is continually calling us to a deeper relationship
                with Him. So then, what is Confirmation?
            </p>

            <p>
                <u>Confirmation is Transforming:</u> This is the last of the Sacraments of Initiation you will receive in
                your life. This sacrament leaves an indelible mark, which means it's unremoveable. You are marking your soul
                for eternity. You are activating the grace you received at your Baptism and ceoming the person Christ created
                you to be.
            </p>

            <p>
                <u>Confirmation is Missionary:</u> By being Confirmed, you are taking the mission of the Catholic Church
                on as your own, "to go and make disciples of all nations." - Matthew 28:19
            </p>

            <p>
                <u>Confirmation is Life Changing:</u> This sacrament has the power to change your life if you let it. Many
                teens have entered Confirmation preparation nsure of whether they want to be Confirmed and end up falling
                deeper in love with the Lord.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please know that the whole CORE team is praying for you that this Confirmation journey will draw you closer to Christ.
