            you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria,

            There is a lot of excitement and a lot of confusion when it comes to the
             Sacrament of Confirmation. Let’s start with what Confirmation is NOT.

          <h3>Misconception #1</h3>
          <p>
            You Become an Adult in the Church with the Sacrament of Confirmation.
             The Sacrament used to be celebrated at birth and now varies in age as
             to when it’s celebrated. It marks a sign of spiritual maturity, but not
             being an “adult” in the eyes of the Church.

        <div class="col-md-4 card">
          <h3>Misconception #2</h3>
          <p>
            The Sacrament of Confirmation is about “choosing to be Catholic” by
             “confirming” your faith. The Sacrament of Confirmation is about
             strengthening and completing the grace you were given at Baptism. While
             you must discern if you are ready for this sacrament, you are not
             “choosing” to become Catholic or making your faith your own.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4 card">
          <h3>Misconception #3</h3>
          <p>
            You graduate from religious education once you are confirmed and can
             now choose what is right for you in your faith. Confirmation is a
             sacrament of initiation. Our faith is a lifelong journey. We can always
             experience deeper conversion, and Jesus is continually calling us to a
             deeper relationship with Him. So then, what is Confirmation?

          <h3>Confirmation is Transforming</h3>
          <p>
            This is the last of the Sacraments of Initiation you will receive in
             your life. This sacrament leaves an indelible mark, which means it's
             unremoveable. You are marking your soul for eternity. You are activating
             the grace you received at your Baptism and ceoming the person Christ
             created you to be.
          </p>

        <div class="col-md-4 card">
          <h3>Confirmation is Missionary</h3>
          <p>
            By being Confirmed, you are taking the mission of the Catholic Church
             on as your own, "to go and make disciples of all nations."
             - Matthew 28:19

          <h3>Confirmation is Life Changing</h3>
          <p>
            This sacrament has the power to change your life if you let it. Many
             teens have entered Confirmation preparation nsure of whether they want
             to be Confirmed and end up falling deeper in love with the Lord.
