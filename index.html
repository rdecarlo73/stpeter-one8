      <p>
        There is a lot of excitement and a lot of confusion when it comes to the
         Sacrament of Confirmation. Let’s start with what Confirmation is NOT.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Misconception #1:</strong>
         You Become an Adult in the Church with the Sacrament of Confirmation.
         The Sacrament used to be celebrated at birth and now varies in age as
         to when it’s celebrated. It marks a sign of spiritual maturity, but not
         being an “adult” in the eyes of the Church.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Misconception #2:</strong>
         The Sacrament of Confirmation is about “choosing to be Catholic” by
         “confirming” your faith. The Sacrament of Confirmation is about
         strengthening and completing the grace you were given at Baptism. While
         you must discern if you are ready for this sacrament, you are not
         “choosing” to become Catholic or making your faith your own.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Misconception #3:</strong>
         You graduate from religious education once you are confirmed and can
         now choose what is right for you in your faith. Confirmation is a
         sacrament of initiation. Our faith is a lifelong journey. We can always
         experience deeper conversion, and Jesus is continually calling us to a
         deeper relationship with Him. So then, what is Confirmation?
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Confirmation is Transforming:</u>
        This is the last of the Sacraments of Initiation you will receive in
        your life. This sacrament leaves an indelible mark, which means it&#39;s
        unremoveable. You are marking your soul for eternity. You are activating
        the grace you received at your Baptism and ceoming the person Christ
        created you to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Confirmation is Missionary:</u>
         By being Confirmed, you are taking the mission of the Catholic Church
         on as your own, "to go and make disciples of all nations."
         - Matthew 28:19
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Confirmation is Life Changing:</u>
         This sacrament has the power to change your life if you let it. Many
         teens have entered Confirmation preparation nsure of whether they want
         to be Confirmed and end up falling deeper in love with the Lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please know that the whole CORE team is praying for you that this
         Confirmation journey will draw you closer to Christ.
